# Mapping_Earthquakes
Data Analytics Boot Camp Module 13

Using Leaflet.js, D3.js, and GeoJSON.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this project was to produce maps that displayed earthquake data with location and magnitude worldwide over the given time of our dataset. With multiple options for the viewer to select.

## Execution:
To complete this project, we used a GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieved geographical coordinates of its location, and used leaflet style options to make the circle marker size indicated the magnitudes of each earthquake. We add the tectonic plates data to include lines on the maps as well as created a color code for ranges of magnitude levels with a legend to explain to make it easier to see the diffent sized earthquakes.  We added a layer for the major earthquakes that was available as a selection object. Finally, we added an additional “dark” map in addition to the Street and Satellite views we already had.
